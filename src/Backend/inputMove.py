#This file will take audio input, and will only send a valid chess move as output.
#The process will be repeated until a valid chess move is taken as input, and confirmed by user.

def hear_move:
    #todo
    #this function will take the input, convert it to the nearest legal chess move
    #now here i can either check the similarity with all the legal moves and choose the closest move, or i can
    #take the audio regardless, and check for legality later
    #Etc methods, but this function will make sense out of the audio text to a move.

def confirm_move:
    #todo
    #this function will simply confirm from the user if they wish to move ahead with the move

def is_valid_move:
    #todo
    #if in the first function we go with similarity with the legal moves, then this might not be required.
